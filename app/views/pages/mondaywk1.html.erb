        <p class='subnavtext'>Your acting task for today is to find your first monologue!
    This may sound like a super easy task, however there is so much to take in account when choosing a monologue so I want you to answer IN DEPTH these questions. Each answer should be around 5-6 lines minimum.
    <br>
    1. Why do I like this monologue? What about this monologue attracts me to it/makes me want to perform it. <br>
    2. Is this monologue right for me? Is the character similar to me? Can I relate to what they are going through or describing? <br>
    3. Where is the monologue from? Playwright, Author? Who performed it originally? What is the play called? <br>
    4. Describe the character. Where are they from? What do they look like? Describe them in detail. <br>
    5. Context? What has just happened to the character before this moment? <br>
